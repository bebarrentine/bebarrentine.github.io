    <h1>Courage the Cowardly Dog</h1>
    
    <p>My favorite cartoon is Courage the Cowardly Dog. It aired on TV from 1996 to 2002. Courage is a small, pink dog with serious anxiety issues. These anxiety issues were probably in part due to the insane things that went on around his home, the middle of nowhere. Despite being cowardly and anxious, Courage proves time and time again that he will stop at nothing to rescue his friends and owners from these mysterious dangers.</p>
